   https://github.com/refs/ocis-mono/ocis-accounts/pull/102


* Change - We make use of the roles cache to enforce permission checks: [#100](https://github.com/refs/ocis-mono/ocis-accounts/pull/100)

   The roles cache and its cache update middleware are used to make permission checks possible.
   The permission checks take place in the accounts handler.

   https://github.com/refs/ocis-mono/ocis-accounts/pull/100


* Change - We make use of the roles manager to enforce permission checks: [#108](https://github.com/refs/ocis-mono/ocis-accounts/pull/108)

   The roles cache and its cache update middleware have been replaced with a roles manager in
   ocis-pkg/v2. We've switched over to the new roles manager implementation, to prepare for
   permission checks on grpc requests as well.

## Details

* Bugfix - Atomic Requests: [#82](https://github.com/refs/ocis-mono/ocis-accounts/pull/82)

   Operations on the file system level are now atomic. This happens only on the provisioning API.

   https://github.com/refs/ocis-mono/ocis-accounts/pull/82


* Bugfix - Unescape value for prefix query: [#76](https://github.com/refs/ocis-mono/ocis-accounts/pull/76)

   Prefix queries also need to unescape token values like `'some ''ol string'` to `some 'ol
   string` before using it in a prefix query

   https://github.com/refs/ocis-mono/ocis-accounts/pull/76


* Change - Adapt to new ocis-settings data model: [#87](https://github.com/refs/ocis-mono/ocis-accounts/pull/87)

   Ocis-settings introduced UUIDs and less verbose endpoint and message type names. This PR
   adjusts ocis-accounts accordingly.

   https://github.com/refs/ocis-mono/ocis-accounts/pull/87
   https://github.com/owncloud/ocis-settings/pull/46


* Change - Add permissions for language to default roles: [#88](https://github.com/refs/ocis-mono/ocis-accounts/pull/88)

   Ocis-settings has default roles and exposes the respective bundle uuids. We now added
   permissions for reading/writing the preferred language to the default roles.

## Details

* Bugfix - Add write mutexes: [#71](https://github.com/refs/ocis-mono/ocis-accounts/pull/71)

   Concurrent account or groups writes would corrupt the json file on disk, because the different
   goroutines would be treated as a single thread from the os. We introduce a mutex for account and
   group file writes each. This locks the update frequency for all accounts/groups and could be
   further improved by using a concurrent map of mutexes with a mutex per account / group. PR
   welcome.

   https://github.com/refs/ocis-mono/ocis-accounts/pull/71


* Bugfix - Fix the accountId and groupId mismatch in DeleteGroup Method: [#60](https://github.com/refs/ocis-mono/ocis-accounts/pull/60)

   We've fixed a bug in deleting the groups.

   The accountId and GroupId were swapped when removing the member from a group after deleting the
   group.

   https://github.com/refs/ocis-mono/ocis-accounts/pull/60


* Bugfix - Fix index mapping: [#73](https://github.com/refs/ocis-mono/ocis-accounts/issues/73)

   The index mapping was not being used because we were not using the right blevesearch TypeField,
   leading to username like properties like `preferred_name` and
   `on_premises_sam_account_name` to be case sensitive.

   https://github.com/refs/ocis-mono/ocis-accounts/issues/73


* Bugfix - Use NewNumericRangeInclusiveQuery for numeric literals: [#28](https://github.com/owncloud/ocis-glauth/issues/28)

   Some LDAP properties like `uidnumber` and `gidnumber` are numeric. When an OS tries to look up a
   user it will not only try to lookup the user by username, but also by the `uidnumber`:
   `(&(objectclass=posixAccount)(uidnumber=20000))`. The accounts backend for glauth was
   sending that as a string query `uid_number eq '20000'` and has been changed to send it as
   `uid_number eq 20000`. The removed quotes allow the parser in ocis-accounts to identify the
   numeric literal and use the NewNumericRangeInclusiveQuery instead of a TermQuery.

   https://github.com/owncloud/ocis-glauth/issues/28
   https://github.com/refs/ocis-mono/ocis-accounts/pull/68
   https://github.com/owncloud/ocis-glauth/pull/29


* Bugfix - Prevent segfault when no password is set: [#65](https://github.com/refs/ocis-mono/ocis-accounts/pull/65)

   Passwords are stored in a dedicated child struct of an account. We fixed several segfault
   conditions where the methods would try to unset a password when that child struct was not
   existing.

   https://github.com/refs/ocis-mono/ocis-accounts/pull/65


* Bugfix - Update account return value not used: [#70](https://github.com/refs/ocis-mono/ocis-accounts/pull/70)

   In order to return a value using the micro go code we need to override the `out` value.

   https://github.com/refs/ocis-mono/ocis-accounts/pull/70


* Bugfix - Build docker images with alpine:latest instead of alpine:edge: [#64](https://github.com/refs/ocis-mono/ocis-accounts/pull/64)

   ARM builds were failing when built on alpine:edge, so we switched to alpine:latest instead.

   https://github.com/refs/ocis-mono/ocis-accounts/pull/64


* Change - Align structure of this extension with other extensions: [#51](https://github.com/refs/ocis-mono/ocis-accounts/pull/51)

   We aim to have a similar project structure for all our ocis extensions. This extension was
   different with regard to the structure of the server command and naming of some flag names.

   https://github.com/refs/ocis-mono/ocis-accounts/pull/51


* Change - Change api errors: [#11](https://github.com/refs/ocis-mono/ocis-accounts/issues/11)

   Replaced the plain golang errors with the error model from the micro framework.

   https://github.com/refs/ocis-mono/ocis-accounts/issues/11


* Change - Enable accounts on creation: [#43](https://github.com/refs/ocis-mono/ocis-accounts/issues/43)

   Accounts have been created with the account_enabled flag set to false. Now when they are
   created accounts will be enabled per default.

   https://github.com/refs/ocis-mono/ocis-accounts/issues/43


* Change - Fix index update on create/update: [#57](https://github.com/refs/ocis-mono/ocis-accounts/issues/57)

   We fixed a bug in creating/updating accounts and groups, that caused new entities not to show up
   in list queries.

   https://github.com/refs/ocis-mono/ocis-accounts/issues/57
   https://github.com/refs/ocis-mono/ocis-accounts/pull/59


* Change - Pass around the correct logger throughout the code: [#41](https://github.com/refs/ocis-mono/ocis-accounts/issues/41)

   Pass around the logger to have consistent log formatting, log level, etc.

   https://github.com/refs/ocis-mono/ocis-accounts/issues/41
   https://github.com/refs/ocis-mono/ocis-accounts/pull/48


* Change - Remove timezone setting: [#33](https://github.com/refs/ocis-mono/ocis-accounts/pull/33)

   We had a timezone setting in our profile settings bundle. As we're not dealing with a timezone
   yet it would be confusing for the user to have a timezone setting available. We removed it, until
   we have a timezone implementation available in ocis-web.

   https://github.com/refs/ocis-mono/ocis-accounts/pull/33


* Change - Tighten screws on usernames and email addresses: [#65](https://github.com/refs/ocis-mono/ocis-accounts/pull/65)

   In order to match accounts to the OIDC claims we currently rely on the email address or username
   to be present. We force both to match the [W3C recommended
   regex](https://www.w3.org/TR/2016/REC-html51-20161101/sec-forms.html#valid-e-mail-address)
   with usernames having to start with a character or `_`. This allows the username to be presented
   and used in ACLs when integrating the os with the glauth LDAP service of ocis.

   https://github.com/refs/ocis-mono/ocis-accounts/pull/65


* Enhancement - Add early version of cli tools for user-management: [#69](https://github.com/refs/ocis-mono/ocis-accounts/pull/69)

   Following commands are available:

   List, ls List existing accounts add, create, Create a new account update Make changes to an
   existing account remove, rm Removes an existing account inspect Show detailed data on an
   existing account

   See --help for details.

   Note that not all account-attributes have an effect yet. This is due to ocis being in an early
   development stage.

   https://github.com/owncloud/product/issues/115
   https://github.com/refs/ocis-mono/ocis-accounts/pull/69


* Enhancement - Update accounts API: [#30](https://github.com/refs/ocis-mono/ocis-accounts/pull/30)

   We updated the api to allow fetching users not onyl by UUID, but also by identity (OpenID issuer
   and subject) email, username and optionally a password.

   https://github.com/refs/ocis-mono/ocis-accounts/pull/30


* Enhancement - Add simple user listing UI: [#51](https://github.com/refs/ocis-mono/ocis-accounts/pull/51)

   We added an extension for ocis-web that shows a simple list of all existing users.
